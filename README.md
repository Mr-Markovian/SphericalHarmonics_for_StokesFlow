# Calculating Stokes flow inside a Sphere given the surface velocity via Vector Spherical Harmonics
[Vector Spherical Harmonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_spherical_harmonics) are derived from the standard spherical harmonics which are the eigenfucntions of laplacian operator in spherical geometry.

The problem involved solving analytically Stokes equation in spherical geometry as an idealized situation in order to model and understand the bulkflows in the cytoskeleton of a cell.
The calculations were done analytically and the plots of various possible fields was generated using python and 
mayavi library. The work was carried out in my summer project in 2018 under the guidance of [Prof. Vijaykumar Krishnamurthy](https://www.icts.res.in/people/vijay-krishnamurthy) at ICTS .
The analytical [results](https://github.com/Mr-Markovian/SphericalHarmonics_for_StokesFlow/blob/main/codes/Analytical_bulkvelocity_calculation.pdf) and the [report](https://github.com/Mr-Markovian/SphericalHarmonics_for_StokesFlow/blob/main/SummerProject_Report_2018.pdf) are linked.
