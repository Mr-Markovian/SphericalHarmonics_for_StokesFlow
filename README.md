# Stokes flow inside a Sphere given the surface velocity via Vector Spherical Harmonics
The problem involved solving analytically Stokes equation in spherical geometry under low renolds number as an idealized situation in order to understand and model the flow generation in the cytoskeleton inside a cell.
The calculations were done analytically and the plots of various possible fields was generated using python and 
mayavi library. The work was carried out in my summer project in 2018 under the guidance of Prof. Vijaykumar Krishnamurthy at ICTS .
